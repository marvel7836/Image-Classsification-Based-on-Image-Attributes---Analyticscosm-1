RECIPE:
Brussels Sprouts Caesar Salad: -2lbs. brussels sprouts, shaved thin on a mandolin or with a sharp knife
- drizzle extra virgin olive oil
- squeeze lemon juice
- fat pinch salt
-1 ripe avocado, sliced
- gluten-free croutons (optional)
- walnuts shaved on a microplane, to garnish (optional) 
Dressing: -1/2 c Plain Kite Hill Greek-style yogurt
-1 tablespoon lemon juice
-1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
-1 1/2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
-2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
-2 teaspoons capers
-1 clove garlic, grated on a microplane
-Salt & pepper, to taste
-1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
1. Toss shaved brussels sprouts with the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt.  Use your hands and mix everything together for about 1 minute.  Set aside.
2. Make the dressing.  In a food processor fitted with a metal “s” blade, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, vinegar, nutritional yeast, Dijon, capers, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.  With the machine running drizzle in the ¼ cup of olive oil until everything is combined.  Remove the lid and check the dressing, if it’s too thick, add the extra 2 tablespoons of olive oil and combine once again.  Taste and adjust salt if needed. 
3. To the shaved brussels sprouts, add roughly half the dressing and mix.  Taste, and add more dressing and salt if needed.  Top w/ sliced avocado, gf croutons & shaved walnuts","['HowIJanuary', 'Sponsored', 'MakesMeWhole']",1547919888

Almond Butter Cookies: - 1 1/4 cups almond butter

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the almond butter, sweetener, and egg until thoroughly combined. 
3. Using a cookie scoop, or by hand, portion the cookie dough into 1 ½ tablespoon balls and place them on your cookie sheet leaving about an inch between each cookie.  Using a fork, gently press the cookies cookies down making an imprint.
