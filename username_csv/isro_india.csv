“We are using the data from these satellites to provide alerts on flooding, areas of inundation during and after rain, and weather forecasts,” the official said. Officials said the data is processed at the Decision Support Centre (DSC) at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in Hyderabad and is disseminated periodically to the Centre and the state under the disaster management support programme of Isro. INSAT-3DR, an advanced meteorological satellite configured with an imaging system and an atmospheric sounder, provides data on various parameters like temperature and humidity to forecast weather.

Its performance has been satisfactory.”
Under a pilot project, the railways had last year installed Isro-developed integrated circuit (IC) chips on some train engines. The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (or NaVIC) was used to caution road users at unmanned crossings about approaching trains through hooters installed at these crossings. Explaining its functions, Misra said, “A hooter gets activated as soon as it gets signal from the IC chip installed on a train when its engine is at a distance of 500 metres to 4 km from the crossing. The hooter, linked to the navigation system, thus warns road users about the approaching train. It becomes louder as the train approaches the crossing and goes silent after the train has passed.”

If you have the passion to achieve your goal, then no one can stop you, said scientist Chunaram Dhatarwal from Barmer, who has been selected in ISRO. Dhatarwal was given a warm welcome when he reached Veer Tejaji Hostel at Balotara in Barmer district on Monday. He addressed the students and gave them tips to achieve success. He was welcomed by various voluntary organisations. A resident of Baytu near Pakistan border in Barmer district, Dhatarwal scored 12th rank at all India level in ISRO exam. During school days, Dhatarwal would walk four kilometres bare feet from his village to school. Our house had no light so he would study in the light of chimney, said his father Bholaram.In #Barmer and Jaisalmer, the temperature during summers goes up to 50 degrees and it is very difficult to walk on sand. Our financial condition was very weak due to which my elder son Kishan Kumar could not study and started working in a factory from young age. However, Dhatarwal was determined to study even under such tough circumstances. He wanted to become a scientist since childhood. ISRO Central recruitment board, 2017, had organised an exam for 35 posts and Dhatarwal achieved 12th rank at all India level. Who says you cannot make hole in the sky, just throw a stone, Dhatarwal said, who has followed this principle in life. His farmer father studied till Class VIII, and his mother Ramu Devi is a homemaker, who is illiterate. Till Class VIII, Dhatarwal went to government middle school 4km away from his village. Later, he joined Navodaya School at Pachpadra. He got top rank in Class XII and won gold medal. His elder brother quit his studies and started working in a factory to support the family and continue Dhatarwal’s studies. Even today, there is no electricity in his village. The first place in ISRO exam was bagged by Sunder Sharma and second position by Kanwaljot Singh Sandhu. Dhatarwal gave the credit of his success to his parents and elder brother. Apart from them, teacher Chimnaram Jani guided him which helped him choose this route.Moreover, Dr Abdul #Kalam has been his idol and he is eager to follow his principles.

Climate there was very harsh. We were very careful while going out of our climate-controlled research station. One had to wear polar clothing. Even 2 or 3 hours out in severe cold was too much and one had to come back immediately for warm-up.” When stationed at Bharati during the polar wintering, she was not only the solitary woman in the Indian expedition team but the only female in that zone as the Russian and Chinese earth stations also did not have any woman during the 2016-17 period.

The moon is a crucial and close destination for research and planetary exploration not just for ISRO but many of the world’s national and international space agencies (such as NASA, ESA, and others). Lunar missions are the first steps in expanding the manned and unmanned exploration of our solar system.
The moon can be used as a laboratory with lower gravity (1/6 of the earth’s gravity field) as it is the closest and most accessible planetary object from Earth.With that in mind, the space research organisation has planned to build ‘lunar habitats,’ which will serve as an “outpost” by sending robots and 3D printers to the Moon. It will be built by using the soil there, as well as other materials.
M Annadurai, Director, ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC) told the TOI, “We are planning to use the Moon as an outpost—like missions in Antarctica. In the long run, the space station is likely to be scrapped. Many countries, including the US, are considering building more permanent structures on the Moon and working out of there. When that happens, we want India to have contributed.”

He also said that the resources that could support human habitation need to be investigated.
On future of Mars exploration, he said, ""The next step would be to search for signs of life and investigate resources that could support human habitation.""
""We need to develop capabilities by solving problems going into deep space also. We need to remain relevant and need to solve issues differently. The world is changing very fast and private entrepreneurs are entering the segment,"" he said.
Kumar was speaking at an inaugural talk at Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) on Wednesday.
He said that ISRO is currently in the process to build reusable launch vehicles. He also said that new technologies for interplanetary missions is also in the works.
Kumar said that this has been done in an effort to reduce the cost incurred in the launch of vehicles.
""We are also on the lookout for equipping with capabilities to carry objects in multiple launches than single launches. We want to reduce cost of access and hence are building reusable launch vehicles,"" Kumar said.
A three-day brainstorming session on 'Vision and Explorations for Planetary Sciences in Decades 2020-2060' has been organised by PRL to provide a forum for planetary researchers and academicians. They can discuss, explore and present the latest trends, promote understanding and exchange results and opinions in the area of planetary sciences and explorations.
Many newer institutions are setting up an astronomy department in their institutes. One of the IITs has even roped in NASA scientists for their astronomy department. 
What is Reusable Launch Vehicle? 
A reusable launch vehicle or #RLV is a launch system intended to allow for recovery of all or part of its components for later reuse. This contrasts with expendable launch systems, where each launch vehicle is launched once and then discarded. To date, no 100 per cent reusable orbital launch system has ever been created.
