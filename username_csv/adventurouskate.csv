This is my first trip back since 2006, and WOW, is it a different place. It’s got golf carts and WiFi and an Apple store. ✨ Honestly, don’t come here in the high season at all (which it is now) — it’s just WAY too crowded and dominated by tourists. You can barely move in the city center. It makes me feel lucky for experiencing Florence as a 20-year-old because I didn’t know any better — I just thought it was amazing. And to be fair, the artistic treasures here are sublime — it’s just that Florence is a little too small to contain all these tourists. I’m glad I came back to see it, but I don’t think I’ll be back unless I have a VERY good reason. Today my heart belongs to cities like Bologna where you can just chill among the locals and get spoken to in Italian first, not English. 🍹 I have to admit I spent most of today tracking down my old haunts — some of the awful Irish pubs I frequented still exist, like JJ’s and The Old Stove. And I had to have pizza at the restaurant across from my old apartment, Le Collinine, now called Oinos. See more on my Stories today. 🌈 Did you study abroad?

There USED to be a K train — but it was discontinued in December 1988. Trains used to have single letters if they were local and double if they were express, but they later scraped that system. Most strangely, today’s C trains still contain those signs predating 1988, and they are inside the trains of today. Some pranksters got a hex key and turned it until it brought up the K signs.

It’s an amazing spot for adventurous travelers who go with the flow — but duuuuude, this country is not for everyone. You’ve got to be okay with planning the whole trip eat in advance, because some lodges have no internet and only check email once a week. You’ve got to be okay being one of very few tourists around.

With that, though, I’ve realized that the safari outfit I bought for Kenya in October was super tight in #Guyana in March, especially the pants. 😝 My eating habits haven’t been great over the past few months, and even though I work out a ton, it wasn’t enough to make up for what I was eating. So it’s time for another round of #Whole30! 🍇30 days of clean eating: no grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, or anything artificial or processed. It’s simpler than it sounds — you basically eat meat, fish, or eggs with veggies for every meal. I did it in 2017 and LOVED how it made me feel — I had tons of energy, didn’t have so much as a headache, and my period was pain-free (!!). 🍎 I highly recommend trying it if you have a 30-day time period with no travel or eating obligations. You might find out your body is sensitive to something you didn’t know about. 🌞 I just did a body composition scan at the gym to compare before and after and found out that yeah, I’ve packed on some fat this winter, but I also have more muscle on my body than ever before! That makes me happy! 💪🏼 Here’s hoping that a month of cutting out junk food not only lets me fit into my pants again, but helps me lift heavier weights, dance harder at Zumba, throw my friends’ kids in the air without getting winded, hike harder through the Dolomites in June, and get into some healthier cooking habits that last long-term.

Guys...my adventure in the remote interior of #Guyana was EVEN BETTER than I thought it would be. OH MY GOD.
🇬🇾
Imagine the most beautiful, untouched scenery for hundreds of miles. I saw an anteater, giant otters, and watched a team capture a caiman lizard the size of a crocodile. I rode an ATV over termite mounds into the sunset. I swam in a creek and hung from a palm tree like a monkey. I hiked a mountain and scooted down on sizzling hot rocks. I photographed cowboys roping and branding cattle. I watched Roraima (!!) rise defiantly above the clouds. I stayed with welcoming indigenous families who celebrate Holi and listen to Hindi music. I lived happily with little electricity and no internet, and I developed a fine crust of sweat and dirt on my body that would re-emerge moments after washing. I stood before Kaieteur Falls in wonder. And it wasn’t all good — at one point I saw a mouse kick its droppings off the ceiling and onto me; at another time, a cockroach hatched its babies underneath my jeans. Why do I share this? Because Guyana is a HELL of an adventure — but most people can’t handle the rougher aspects.
🇬🇾
If you’re one of the few who can, this is one of the most rewarding adventure destinations you can visit — a place so new to tourism that lodges exist on word of mouth. There are few places in this world that are full of incredible attractions, safe to visit, and have almost no tourists. This is one of them.

There are no chains or big-name brands. And guess what — in October they passed legislation banning single-use plastics and new construction on the island!! I am beyond happy to hear that — it shows that they’re preserving Holbox long-term instead of making a cash grab. 🌮 I wrote about my time in Holbox in today’s blog post, as well as my stay at the incomparable @casasandra boutique hotel — the link is in my profile. Hope you enjoy it! Thanks @bia1973 for the pic! 💕 Have you ever been to a place that banned single-use plastics?","['Holbox', 'Mexico']",1548878805

Watching the Vikings throw the torches at the boat...watching the Vikings sing the Broadway tune “Enjoy yourself”...dancing with men in kilts until 8:00 in the morning. THE BEST TIME EVER. If you go, go with Haggis, because they have access that nobody else has, including tickets to the best party. Believe me, you want to go to the best party. 🥳 I’m going to quote the two Shetlanders on the street after a night of drinking: “Happy Up Helly Aa, ya couple o’pricks!” 🤣 Is this event on your bucket list?","['Shetland', 'UpHellyAa']",1548789766

It’s a 45-minute ride in a speedboat from the main beach area of Holbox — and it’s so worth it because LOOK HOW DESERTED THIS IS. Imagine if this were Koh Phi Phi and there were Maya Bay-level crowds around here. So I enjoyed it. I strolled. I posed (had to). And I enjoyed the most mellifluous escape from New York in January. Ha! 🙃 Did you go anywhere warm this month? Or are you stuck in the cold? Or are you laughing at all of us because you live someplace warm year-round?,"['Holbox', 'CaboCatoche', 'Mexico']",1548708282

It felt like a Wes Anderson hotel lobby! Brightly saturated teal along with shell pink decor. The coffees were delicious — they even made a smoked coffee beverage and they have taps for all kinds of milks. So why did I initially panic? BECAUSE THIS IS THE NEXT INSTAGRAM HOTSPOT AND NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT YET. So, do I mention its name and watch it explode? Or do I let it happen naturally, as it inevitably will? Or do I do the gross and selfish thing and go take my own photos before revealing any info? I don’t know. Edit: it’s @felixroastingco! 🍨 Do you ever wrestle with revealing cool places on social media? This is honestly the most conflicted I’ve felt over a place to date.",[],1548110297

I did and loved it. 🐧 Now, I don’t mean going off on a raft completely on your own and living in a tent among the penguins. That’s just for scientists (and they are badasses). What I mean is signing up for an Antarctica expedition on your own — no travel companions or buddies, just you on a ship full of strangers. It may sound scary or intimidating, but it shouldn’t be. Tons of other women were doing the same thing (most of them in their forties and fifties) and you’ll make tons of friends no matter what! Plus, I think that it’s best to experience Antarctica solo, so you can breathe the continent in without being distracted by a partner. I talk about this in my latest post — link in profile.
