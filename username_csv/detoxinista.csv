•
This is a great way to ease picky family members into eating more veggies, too.👌 When you peel the zucchini before spiralizing it, it blends right in with the other pasta and the texture is almost unnoticeable! Over time you can add more and more zucchini to see how much you can get away with. 😉

I can’t think of a better reason to make this Chocolate Avocado Pudding! 🙌🏻

According to the results from the National Health & Nutrition Examination, which observed over 17,500 participants, avocado eaters tend to weigh less and and have a significantly lower risk of metabolic syndrome compared to those who don’t eat avocado. (This study also noted that people who eat avocados tend to eat more veggies than those who don’t, so I’m sure that has a lot to do with these results, too!)
•
I’ve been making this avocado pudding for nearly 10 years and I’m still surprised by how much I love it— and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t *love* avocados. In this updated post, I talk about more benefits of eating avocados and some alternative ways to sweeten it, too!

Jackfruit is a relatively new ingredient to me, but I love how it’s becoming more and more accessible in most grocery stores! Green jackfruit has a chewy texture and neutral flavor that absorbs whatever sauce you cook it with. When you toss it with my easy homemade BBQ sauce, it really does remind me of pulled pork! (Only not as chewy— so it’s easier to eat.)

My kids do help me add handfuls of fresh spinach to our smoothie most mornings, so they don’t seem to mind, but I think it helps that they know they won’t taste it! 😉
•
Other veggies that you can sneak in without detection? Frozen cauliflower and sometimes frozen broccoli (if the smoothie has a strong tropical flavor). Kale can NOT be “hidden” if you ask me. My kids can taste kale, and so can I. I don’t mind it, but it’s not fooling anyone. 😂

Tell me, do you try to sneak anything into your smoothies? I’ve gone through all sorts of supplement experiments, like spirulina and collagen, but right now our go-to protein addition is just plain hemp hearts! I love that they are a complete source of #plantbased protein, without a chalky texture.

Not the best “healthy” donut, but THE. BEST. DONUT. around. 🍩🙌🏻 When I was in New York last weekend, I tried several different places, including this one from @levainbakery
•
I mention this because I don’t want my Instagram account to come off as if I only eat healthy food 100% of the time. I enjoy creating healthy recipes that are EASY and TASTE GOOD, so that’s what I share here most of the time, but I also want you to know that I’m human, and I do still reach for things like donuts, french fries, and potato chips. (And pizza!) 🍕
•
I allow myself to eat EVERYTHING because, for years, I struggled with binge eating. (For at least a good third of my life!) In my case, it was triggered by dieting and a struggle with perfectionism. If I ""slipped up"" during a diet, I was off the wagon for the rest of the day— and often times for the rest of the week, eating to the point that I was uncomfortable because I knew those foods would be off-limits to me again in the future. It’s not a fun way to live, always being “on” or “off” a diet. 👎🏻
•
The only way I was able to finally stop this miserable cycle of yo-yo dieting was to also STOP feeling guilty about eating certain foods. Your pants size won’t change from eating one donut or going out for pizza with your friends. It’s what you do MOST OF THE TIME that counts, and it’s easier to make good choices when your brain isn’t clouded by arbitrary diet rules.
•
If you have struggled with something like this, I hope you’ll find a similar sense of food freedom! You can read more about how I stopped binge eating by clicking on my profile link ( @detoxinista ) and then clicking on this photo.

And tell me— is there a certain food that YOU seek out when traveling?? Let me know! 👇

Try using QUINOA! 💪🏻
•
Quinoa is a “super seed” because it’s a COMPLETE SOURCE of plant-based protein, containing all of the essential amino acids the body can’t make on its own.
•
One thing to know about quinoa is that you must soak it to remove its bitter flavor for recipes like this one. It doesn’t take long, but it makes a big difference in the overall taste! I like to top mine like I would regular cereal out of a box— with some almond milk and fruit.
•
You can make a big batch all at once and then serve it chilled for the rest of the week or weekend! (I actually love to #mealprep for the weekend so that I don’t have to spend my days off in the kitchen! 😉)
•
Do YOU meal prep for the weekend?? Let me know in the comments below! And head to my profile 👉 @detoxinista for a link to this recipe.
