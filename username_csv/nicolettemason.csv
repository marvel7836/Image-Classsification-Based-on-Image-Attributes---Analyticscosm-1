The Sunday that I arrived in NYC, June 29 2003, was coincidentally the same day as New York City pride. The first person I met, Joe, and I decided to walk over to 5th Avenue and watch as the parade came down the street. More than anything, that summer served as an intensive in giving me understanding, language, and a sense of belonging in my own identity. I learned about and fell in love with the work of Catherine Opie, I spent afternoons at the piers with friends, I went to see Rent on Broadway with my friend Ojay, and knew that I was just beginning to figure out how expansive queer culture, and love, and relationships, and community can all be. I was enormously privileged to have that experience at 17 years old, and I know first hand how powerful and transformative it can be to have a supportive network of peers and mentors as we navigate our individual identities. In the spirit of that discovery, I'm proud to work with @fossil in support of #HMIxFossil #MakeTimeForGood. This pride month, Fossil is supporting the Hetrick Martin Institute with 100% of proceeds on the sale of their Live in Color watch going to HMI - the largest organization supporting LGBTQ youth and their families. As we celebrate 50 years since Stonewall, and 40 years since HMI opened it's doors, I want to aim the spotlight on the important organizations doing this work not just during Pride month, but all year long üåà‚ù§","['MakeTimeForGood', 'HMIxFossil']",1560819743

I‚Äôve been getting a LOT of questions lately talking about what many have affectionately referred to as ‚Äúthe girls‚Äù or üçí or üçàüçà ‚Äî so, let‚Äôs talk about it! They appeared basically over night when I was in the 5th grade and I genuinely never had a ‚Äútraining bra phase‚Äù because I went from pre-pubescent and flat chested to a D cup before I could even really understand what these body changes meant. I now wear a 36H and while I like my body on most days, I‚Äôve also thought about breast reduction since I was a teenager, and still wonder how it might change my life. As for bras - I have and love SO MANY and am so grateful there are more beautiful options now than there ever have been in my lifetime. And finally, going braless (like I am here) is very, very new to me - and to be honest, I kind of love it, even though it‚Äôs also a bit intimidating and I feel like I‚Äôm breaking a LOT of rules, (and maybe those rules are kind of oppressive and rooted in respectability politics, anyways). Lots of tangents, here, but I get so many DMs about bras and cleavage and what to wear with XYZ that I figure, why not talk about it all in one place?

I committed myself back to therapy, said ‚Äúno‚Äù to more things to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to myself, spent more time with my family, learned how to ask for help and support and patience, and got really fucking good at crying it out and processing all my feelings.
