In the far south of Bavaria is a place called Berchtesgaden. It is probably one of the most beautiful places we have ever visited.
Nestled in the Alps, it offers stunning view after stunning view.
This morning was perfect.
No wind and a beautiful sunrise.

Lake Eibsee is one place you cannot miss when you visit Bavaria.
Not only is it a beautiful backdrop for Germany’s highest peak but the colours from above are just stunning.

You can hike around the lake and get so many different views. There is something jaw dropping around every corner.

One tip I would suggest is to get there early for the best light. When the lift hits the mountains you feel like you are in a dream.

It's that time of year again to get out and explore. ——
Travel often inspires us to try new adventures and hobbies, but it's important to make sure we are protected as we head into the summer travel season. 
We've teamed up with @medjetassist to remind everyone about the importance of medical evacuation coverage. 
We have it, and we don't travel without it. Accidents can happen anytime, anywhere. 
You don't have to be climbing a mountain to have an unexpected emergency, but it helps to know that even if you are doing something extreme, and land yourself in the hospital, Medjet is there to get you medically transferred to your own hospital at home (regardless of medical necessity, which is an important differentiator from insurance).

Looking down from the top of the Westin hotel gives you a birdseye view of this beautiful city. 
I find that Ottawa comes alive at night and this shot really captures the excitement as the sun goes down.

Ottawa is one of those cities that surprises you. With a great food scene, the worlds largest naturally frozen ice rink, and so many sites to see, Ottawa is a great year round destination.

This shot was taken looking North from Ravello. The coastline is dotted with beautiful little towns just like you see here.

It is no wonder this part of Italy is so popular. I would recommend that you visit during the shoulder seasons as it can get pretty crazy in the height of summer.

As our trip to New Brunswick came to a close, we spent the last few days around St. John, and this place was pretty special. 
You see, for us, travel is not only about visiting the popular, “must-see” destinations- it’s also about venturing off the beaten path to find hidden gems; like the Sea Caves at St. Martins beach! 
Sharing these gems with you is one of the main reasons #whywetravel. You can only access the caves at low tide and it was so amazing to see how the landscape changed between low and high tide. 
This is definitely a place you have to seek out when you visit New Brunswick.

While there, we barely saw another soul exploring its secluded beaches, massive bogs and spanning marshlands. We had the sunrise to ourselves on this early morning at Kelly’s Beach. The Boardwalk stretches 1.2 km over the marsh and river, with interpretive signs showcasing the wildlife and their fragile habitat. It’s this kind of wonder and beauty of exploring new places that is exactly why we travel.

Just 30 minutes outside of Moncton is a small little town called Cap Pele. 
There are some great beaches along this part of the coast, but the real attraction is these crazy rock formations and pools that line a small section of the coastline.

The sea has formed these amazing patterns in the rock, and sunset is the perfect time to enjoy them! This is just one of the spots we are excited to photograph and discover here in New Brunswick.

When you guys voted there were so many great suggestions it was hard to narrow it down. We will be checking out Kouchibouguac National Park, Hopewell Rocks, The Fundy Trail, Cape Enrage and many more on our road trip down to Saint John. 
It was all so easy to plan by bundling everything together through Expedia for TD.

Plus we saved a ton of money. If you ask us, that’s the perfect way to plan a vacation. What about you?

—-
Visiting The Golesn Temple was at the top of my list in India. Let me tell you it did not disappoint. 
Located in the state of Punjab this is the holiest religious complex in the Sikh religion. 
It is free to enter and they will even feed you for your efforts of coming to visit.
Actually, The Golden Temple feeds up to 100,000 people a day from the free kitchen run by volunteers.
Not only was this a beautiful piece of architecture, but the spirituality that runs through the halls is contagious. 
This is one place you have to visit if you head to India.

I have to say that the Taj Mahal is one beautiful building. If you can ignore the crowds of people you can really get a great appreciation for this marvel of architecture.

Getting here early in the morning is key to avoid all the people any take in the serenity that seems to envelop you when you are here.

The ruins of Petra are amazing to see at any time of the day. But it is when nigh falls and they light the path to Treasury by paper lanterns that it really comes alive.
Shadows dance off of the walls and you really get a sense of what it might have been like strolling these streets long ago.

My recommendation is to be the last to leave after the show. I lagged behind with my Tripod and shot until the staff took away the lanterns. That way you really have it all to yourself.

Medical emergencies can happen anytime, anywhere and during our trip down the Peruvian Amazon, I broke my back by slipping on a set of steel stairs. 
This photo was taken the day before the accident and is a stark reminder of just how quickly a dream vacation can turn into a nightmare. 
I was hospitalized for 8 days in a jungle hospital before being airlifted out of the Amazon and home to safety. Luckily I had medical evacuation insurance. If I didn't, I would be out of pocket $75k -$100k paying that back for the rest of my life. I most likely wouldn't have healed as quickly as I did. 
We've partnered with @medjetassist to reinforce the importance of medical transport coverage. A Medjet membership means medical transfers from the hospital you are in to your home hospital, regardless of medical necessity. It lets you decide what facility you want to be moved to and it covers both business and personal travel. Find out more in the link in our bio. 
And let us know, do you travel with insurance and medical evacuation coverage?

One thing that has always been a challenge for us it finding healthy snacks and drinks that we can bring with us when we travel. 
Recently we have discovered Montmorency tart cherries. You can mix some of the tart cherry concentrate with water for a refreshing drink and an added burst of energy. 
Not only can they help us fight jet lag, because they help with inflammation and improve sleep, they also taste amazing!""

As we were walking along the trail this lady motioned for us to come closer. She couldn’t speak any English and could just motion with her hands. 
We broke out some snacks and shared them with her in silence.
All the while I couldn’t help but think what change this woman had seen in her life.
After about 20 minutes we had to move on but when we made our way back down she stopped us and shook our hands and thanked us.
