Nobody knows how long ago this hardy beast adapted to the high Arctic by donning a whiter pelt and morphing into the sub-species known as the Svalbard reindeer. Were these stocky, bovine-looking creatures introduced by Swedish trappers as a food source? All we know was that by 1925 they’d been hunted to near extinction. But mankind wised up, passed smarter laws, and Svalbard’s are now among the most protected reindeer in Europe: The archipelago embraces seven of Norway’s 47 national parks. The migrant Samí people hunted reindeer for centuries before they decided to herd them, feed them, and practice sustainable farming long before city scientists came up with the term. The Samí and their reindeer crossed the borders of Norway, Sweden and Finland, in search of lichen to feed the herd. The remains of many ancient reindeer traps still dot these northern landscapes. While no borders stop the migration of Arctic animals, we bipeds had our passports inspected in Tromsø on our way north. If you’re a reindeer of course, no passport required. #Svalbard #reindeer #Norway #arctic","['Svalbard', 'reindeer', 'Norway', 'arctic']",1562407221

Giraffes are gentle and timid animals that live in loose social groups. The giraffe's long neck enables it to browse on the leaves of trees. Thus, it does not need to compete with other leaf-eaters feeding lower down. Giraffes eat leaves of many kinds of trees, but acacia trees are their favorites.

Ballstad is located on a small island off the southwestern tip of the island of Vestvågøya. It is one of the largest fishing communities in the Lofoten archipelago. There is evidence that human settlement in Lofoten extends back thousands of years. The archipelago's Stone Age inhabitants survived by hunting and fishing in an area that was covered by large pine and birch forests. There were bears, deer, reindeer, beavers, and lynx here and the waters teemed with seals and whales. Agriculture was quick to develop too–grain was harvested in Lofoten as early as 4,000 years ago.

The setting moon was softly shining on me while I enjoyed the glory of the southern Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds hanging over the vast Southern Ocean. The two clouds, icons of the southern sky, are our neighboring satellite galaxies, visible to the naked eyes as you see them in this photograph, when you are away from city lights. Watching them, you're looking at light that belongs to about 200,000 years ago, well before early humans reached Australia.
