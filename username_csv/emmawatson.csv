This marks the fourth “heartbeat” law to be passed in the United States in the last year - a name that is designed to be emotive. It refers to the first signs of the development of a heart in a fetus at 6 weeks of pregnancy, long before most people know they are pregnant.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🍑💔 Georgia’s bill stands out for going one step further in including personhood language, criminalising not just abortion providers, but also pregnant people for having abortions or even miscarrying. Today, Alabama passed its own law banning abortion except when the health of the mother is at risk. We remember that Savita Halappanavar died in Ireland with the same law on the books.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🇬🇧💔 Currently, women & pregnant people living in Northern Ireland are forced to travel to mainland Britain for abortion care that is illegal in their home country. There will always be people who cannot travel because of domestic violence, immigration status, and disability. People living in Northern Ireland and the USA deserve the dignity of accessing safe, legal & local reproductive healthcare at home. #nowforni

These laws won't stop women and pregnant people from having abortions, or from making the best decision for their bodies and families, it will just mean they are forced to do so unsafely and with stigma. #reproductiverightsforall ✊

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⌛️💷 Successive UK governments have failed to fund life-saving services. There are just 44 Rape Crisis Centres in England and Wales. 🎯 But the Istanbul Convention (which our Government will soon ratify) sets out a minimum provision of support for victims of rape which would require that there be 150 Rape Crisis Centres in England and Wales. 🚨 It’s simply unacceptable that a country like mine falls so far short of the minimum standards set across Europe.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
📋❤️✍🏻 So on #IWD2019, I encourage you to sign Fern’s petition 👆🏻LINK IN BIO👆🏻and demand that Theresa May guarantees sustained 💰 funding for rape crisis support services, 💌 so the survivors of sexual violence can access the support they need. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🔗📋✍🏻 tinyurl.com/FernsPetition
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
💪🏻👩🏼 These are the words of 25-year-old Fern Champion, who was raped in 2016 and has launched a petition 💌 asking the Prime Minister to ensure that specialist rape counselling support is always available for everyone who seeks it:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🤲🏻 💔 “By not adequately funding support services this Government is telling survivors that their recovery does not matter and by extension that they do not matter. When you have been raped, the vital, life-saving counselling should just be there when you need it.” 🙌🏻❤️👏🏻

I had a lot of fun updating it, hope you’ll feel the same reading it!”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
📚❤️ “Why do I love Gloria’s writing so much? She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading, into something not only relatable but enjoyable...She believes in personal testimony - the sharing and passing on of women’s stories...She uncovers things that are obscured by today’s conditioning and normalizing which when exposed, are absolutely fascinating...Her plain common sense - calling things out as they are - will make you laugh out loud...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Sometimes the world she envisions seems so far out and impossible to me or just wildly optimistic. But I have come to believe it is through radical feminism and the radical nature of Gloria’s message, that the job of equality will get done. I used to think the citadel didn’t have to topple. Now I believe it just might and should, and that we need to let old ways of being die for something new to be born. This book contains ideas for that new road, even though some were written almost forty years ago.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
People have asked me what the feminist movement needs to succeed. A new word? More men involved? I would rephrase the question. What obstacles need to be removed for us to succeed? In order to win our full humanity, in life, we have to confront the biggest superpower in the world: the patriarchy...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I never liked the idea of being a rebel. I played Hermione Granger, for goodness sake, who once famously compared the notion of being expelled to death! I remember thinking my first detention was the end of the world. But of all the things to fight for, I’d say freedom and respect are pretty good ones! And if I can do it with, and in the wake of, women like Gloria, all the better. And actually, as Hermione and I learned, being disruptive was quite fun after all.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So, have your mind blown, laugh out loud, think in new ways, get angry, feel the feminist affinity...This was the first collection of feminist writing Gloria ever published...I hope they become as precious to you.” 🧡📖",['Repost'],1550015375

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
“Dear Our Shared Shelf Readers,
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We are honored to be able to begin a conversation with you about the power and consequence of women’s rage, both personal and political. We could not be prouder or more excited that Audre Lorde’s Sister Outsider, Brittney Cooper’s Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower, and Rebecca Traister’s Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger have been selected as the Our Shared Shelf books for November/December 2018.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The famed feminist activist, poet, and essayist Audre Lorde was one of the foremost thinkers on the importance of anger. In her essay, “The Uses of Anger,” which you will get to read in her book Sister Outsider, she wrote, “every woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger potentially useful against those oppressions, personal and institutional, which brought that anger into being. Focused with precision it can become a powerful source of energy serving progress and change.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
To encounter these words is to be changed by them. We have been changed by them. And we hope that women’s anger, put to use within progressive coalitions in which fury is expressed and treated as instructive, will in turn have the power to change the world.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In this period, as we reckon with the rise of hard right authoritarian regimes around the world, many determined to roll back human rights—the very freedoms generations of angry women before us worked to win—today’s women are again being called to embrace our rage–its force, its potential, its messy complications. The fight against global patriarchy is far from over. Violence abounds but so does the possibility of building a new world from the wreckage of the old one.”

🌱🌷 Reni’s research and candour opened my eyes to how deeply-engrained structural racism is in UK society. Her work enlightened and motivated me to begin a journey of acknowledging the history of racism in Britain. Thank you, Reni, for thoughtfully answering the questions from #OurSharedShelf members and myself.

Rupi Kaur is an Indian-born, Canadian-raised poet and artist. She chooses not to use upper case letters or punctuation in her poems as an ode to her native language, Punjabi. She travels the world, including recently to her native country India, performing her poems and drawing crowds of hundreds. Both of her books, Milk and Honey and The Sun and Her Flowers, have made the New York Times bestseller list, which for a poet, is astonishing.
•••
Over my lifetime, I have fallen in and out of love with poetry. Performing poems was what got me into acting (I had a primary school teacher that made everyone learn one a week, and eventually I won a poetry recital competition!) In secondary school and at university, I loved deciphering the codes of poems in class discussion, but I honestly wondered if poetry would continue to feature in my life outside of an academic context.
•••
Enter poets like @holliepoetry, @SabrinaMahfouz and Rupi Kaur- I demolished whole books in single sittings. Unlike poems I have often spent weeks unraveling, Rupi’s poems are not designed to obscure meaning or entertain too much ambiguity - they hit you like punches to the stomach. They are immediate, visceral and not easily digested. I am loathe to say Rupi has made poetry “accessible” because while this is the truth (Rupi’s poems and illustrations fit well into those famously square shaped Instagram frames), there is nothing easy or accessible about what Rupi chooses to talk about. In fact, the topics she chooses, are audacious.
•••
Here is a 25-year-old girl saying the unsayable… to hundreds of thousands of people: that she has been raped, that at times she has been abused, that she bleeds. And sin of all sins… she actually likes the hair that grows on her body. Yes. She actually thinks it is beautiful. And that she is beautiful as God made her - what a transgression. That her body is her home and nobody else's.
