My dad was an incredible cook, and obsessed with the flavors of Asian cuisine in particular (also, I was never allowed to touch his Chinese cleaver). So, in honor of him ‚Äî and because grilling season has arrived and you're desperately in need of another go-to recipe ‚Äî I partnered with @KikkomanUSA and @Allrecipes to make a dish I know my dad would love.

This Honey-Glazed Chinese Chicken is crazy delicious and the recipe, featuring the iconic Kikkoman¬Æ Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce, is so simple. I like to bake these drumsticks about 3/4 of the way through and then finish them on the grill just before serving. Serve with grilled veggies, on top of rice or noodles, or even pull off the chicken and use as a filling for tacos or lettuce wraps. Also can confirm: The marinade works just as well with wings or boneless chicken thighs.

-
1 lb. Orecchiette pasta
2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil (plus more for garnish)
1 lb. Italian-style pork or chicken sausage
3 garlic cloves, minced
Crushed Calabrian chili flakes (can substitute red pepper flakes), to taste
1 bunch broccoli rabe, stems trimmed and leaves chopped
Sea salt, to taste
Juice and zest from 1 lemon
1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs, store-bought or homemade
8 ounces burrata cheese (if it‚Äôs a ball and not scoopable, cut into small pieces)
-
1. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, according to package directions, just until ‚Ä™al dente‚Ä¨. Reserve the pasta water.
2. Meanwhile, heat oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, garlic and chili flakes and cook, breaking up the sausage with a spoon or potato masher, until browned. Transfer sausage mixture to a plate.
3. Add broccoli rabe to the same pan and sautee for 2-3 min, just until tender. Deglaze with a cup of reserved pasta water, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of ‚Ä™the pan‚Ä¨.
4. Add sausage mixture and pasta to ‚Ä™the pan‚Ä¨ and stir well to combine over low heat, adjusting the consistency with more of the reserved pasta water, if needed. Season to taste with salt.
5. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and grated cheese. Place burrata cheese in the center, then top with bread crumbs, lemon zest, more chili flakes and a drizzle of olive oil.
6. Bring the skillet to the table and, while still hot, toss the burrata until creamy and stringy and the pasta is completely coated. Divide the pasta among shallow bowls and serve with extra bread crumbs and chili flakes on the side for guests.",[],1513731966

2. Place peanuts in the bowl of a food processor and process for approximately 5 minutes or until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.

[another option for the above step is chopping the coconut and pretzels by hand, and then stirring them into the peanut butter along with the honey/agave ‚Äî adding sea salt at the very end, to taste]

4. Store in an airtight jar or container at room temperature for up to several weeks (trust me though, it‚Äôll be gone well before then).

1) Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

3) Transfer cauliflower rice to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir, then microwave for another 2 minutes and stir again.
4) Place the cauliflower in a cheesecloth or dish towel and squeeze out as much water as you can (be careful, it‚Äôs hot)
5) Transfer drained cauliflower back to a bowl and add remaining ingredients. Mix until well combined.
6) Separate the mixture into 6 equal sized balls, then spread each onto a parchment-lined baking sheet to make 6 flat circles.
