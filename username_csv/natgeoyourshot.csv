#YourShotPhotographer Megan Lorenz made this sweet portrait of a Burrowing owlet in Florida. She writes, “An owl’s eyes are large in order to improve their efficiency, especially under low light conditions. Their eyes are actually elongated tubes which are held in place by bony structures in the skull called Sclerotic Rings. For this reason, an owl cannot move its eyes and can only look straight ahead. The owl more than makes up for this by being able to turn its head up to 270 degrees left or right from the forward-facing position and almost upside down.” This photo was selected for the Daily Dozen on June 28, 2019.

“I have a small family, but I had all I ever needed. A wonderful mum and grandma who taught me so much. My protectors, my ‘do-anything-for-you’ givers and my world,” writes #YourShotPhotographer Carole Mills Noronha. “The photo I’m holding here is a memory captured on film. It was 1977. My grandma and mum are sitting watching my sister and I swim on what would have been a hot summers day. This is how that memory would sit in the same suburban backyard today. Both my mum and grandma have passed, but the house remains along with all the memories.” This photo was submitted to our “What is Family?” assignment, edited by Independent Visual Journalist Jackie Molloy.
