• Dolomites are only an hour or two away 🏔
• Family friendly & low crime 👶
• Amazon Prime works!

• Pet friendly (we can take @poofythefluffycat to restaurants!)
• Larger cities like Milan & Venice nearby
• Mild climate
• Regional airport for Europe, train to Milan for overseas flights
• Tons of culture & things to do!

We’ve decided on the Northern Italian city of #Verona, after visiting earlier this year. We tried Colorado, California, and Texas, but just didn’t find what we were looking for in the States. So now we’re off to give Italy a go!

We both have EU passports (I have dual citizenship in Ireland now) and we both work online, which makes moving to Europe possible. We picked Verona because it’s a pretty town that’s not too big but not too small, a short train ride away from larger cities, and very close to the Italian Dolomites, some of the best mountains in Europe.

As a dual citizen of the United States and Ireland, with two passports, I can now travel or live in the European Union without restrictions.

Did you know that about 40 million Americans have Irish ancestry? Many of their ancestors traveled to the United States from the port city of Cobh, pictured here, looking for a better life abroad.

Now more and more American/British citizens are applying for Irish Citizenship, as a hedge against the craziness and ultra-nationalism going on in the world. Giving themselves another option, just in case. 🌎

-
Yes, you can travel to Afghanistan. Women too, although I’m not sure I’d recommended it alone.
-
No, I don’t recommend it solo for most people. It’s what I’d call a “black diamond” destination. Like how they rate ski slopes. You need to work your way up to it.
-
This is a trip I’d been planning for years. Following local news. Tracking down obscure trip reports. Talking to others who’d been recently.
-
For example, the border between Tajikistan & Afghanistan sometimes closes without warning. For days, or weeks. Which would leave you stranded, as the road to Kabul is too dangerous.
-
The Taliban is only 20 miles away. Last year, they captured the border town area (that I entered from) for 2 weeks before being kicked out again.
-
The Wakhi people, like this man, were very welcoming and friendly. However there are less nice people not far away. The situation is constantly changing.
-
And travel in Afghanistan is tough. Just getting to the start of my trek took 2 days of driving through deserts and rivers with multiple breakdowns. Meals were basically flat bread, warm sour yak yogurt, and if you’re lucky, some goat.
-
Just wanted to share a bit behind the scenes for what went into this trip!

Italian authorities have started restricting vehicle traffic into the Dolomites during summer months at Sella Pass, allowing only 350 cars per day (previously up to 5000 cars a day made the trip). It’s a new attempt to curb the massive amount of day-tripping tourism, and help save their stunning environment.

However local restaurant and hotel owners are upset, complaining it will drastically reduce their income, and visitors will simply use a different mountain pass, sending the tourism dollars to other areas. It just goes to show there are no easy answers to solving this problem!
